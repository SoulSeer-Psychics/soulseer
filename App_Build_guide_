## Critical Thinking & Error Prevention Guidelines
 
### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Systematic Analysis**: Before implementing any feature, analyze all potential user journeys and edge cases.
2. **Connection Verification**: Ensure all integrations (Twilio, Stripe, Agora) have proper error handling and fallback mechanisms.
3. **Iterative Testing**: Implement test-feedback-refine cycles for each major feature before proceeding to the next.
 
### Common Pitfall Prevention
1. **Payment Processing Safeguards**:
   - Double-transaction prevention mechanisms
   - Session timeout protection to avoid overcharging
   - Robust refund and dispute resolution systems
 
2. **User Experience Consistency**:
   - Maintain design language across all screens
   - Ensure responsive design works on all device sizes
   - Verify that animations enhance rather than hinder usability
 
3. **Data Management**:
   - Implement proper validation for all user inputs
   - Create clear schemas for user, transaction, and session data
   - Design database relationships that prevent orphaned records
 
### Pattern Recognition & Learning
1. **Error Logging**: Create comprehensive logging for pattern recognition in errors or system failures.
2. **User Behavior Analysis**: Track common user friction points to identify opportunity for improvements.
3. **Automated Testing**: Implement regression testing to prevent reintroduction of fixed bugs.
 
### Self-Correction Protocol
When implementing features, follow this validation sequence:
1. Question assumptions about user behavior and technical requirements
2. Identify potential failure points in the user journey
3. Test edge cases before finalizing any implementation
4. Document solution patterns to prevent repetitive errors
 
### Technical Guardrails
1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
2. **Session Management**: Create robust session handling for timing out inactive connections.
3. **Concurrency Control**: Prevent race conditions in critical operations like payments and bookings.
4. **Transactional Integrity**: Ensure database operations maintain ACID properties where needed.
 
### Cross-Functional Verification
Before finalizing any major component:
1. Verify user flow against business requirements
2. Confirm technical implementation meets security standards
3. Test accessibility compliance
4. Validate performance under various network conditions
 
 
## Implementation Priorities
1. User account system and core infrastructure
2. Payment processing integration
3. Basic reading functionality (chat, call, video)
